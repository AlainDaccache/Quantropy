# Bare minimum Dockerfile configuration. First, make sure you're cd'ed into the Quantropy directory
#    To build the Docker image: 'docker build -t matilda .' (do not forget the dot at the end)
#    To run the Docker image: 'docker run -d -p 5000:5000 matilda'

# && \ isnâ€™t Docker specific, but tells Linux to run the next command as part of the existing line

# Copy files from the first parameter (the source .) to the destination parameter (in this case, /app)
# We copy just the requirements.txt first, in a seperate build step (before adding the entire application into the image)
# to leverage Docker cache (i.e. avoid invalidating the Docker build cache every time you're copying the entire application into the image)
COPY ./requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt

# Sets the working directory (all following instructions operate within this directory) of the Docker container
WORKDIR /app

# pip installs from requirements.txt as normal.
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
