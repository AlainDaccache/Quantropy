While this is not true every single year, over almost every 3 year cycle in the stock market cheap (or value) stocks outperform. This phenomenon has created the cult of 'Value Investing' born of the writings of Benjamin Graham and the phenomenal success of its arch proponent Warren Buffett.\n","\n","Benjamin Graham once said that 'in the short run the market is a voting machine but in the long run it's a weighing machine' snappily illustrating one of the critical ideas for stock market success - that the market over-reacts but eventually corrects itself. But to pick up the extra profit that can be made by exploiting this corrective mechanism, investors have long debated what is meant by 'cheap'.\n","\n","Generalising grossly, most valuation is done by comparing a company's share price against either what it can earn or what it owns. Price/Earnings ratios, Price/Cashflow ratios, Dividend Yield, Earnings Yield, EV/EBITDA ratios etc all aim to judge price against what a company can earn, while Price/Book, Price/Tangible Book, Price/Net current assets, Price/Cash and so on all compare price against what it owns. Consistent with the value investing philosophy, we use historic ratios for each of these metrics, rather than factoring in analyst forecasts. \n","\n","Investors are a hugely sectarian bunch and defend their preferred valuation metrics from all comers. But frankly, over the very long term there isn't that much difference in which ratio one prefers to use. The returns to ALL value ratios are highly correlated over the long run and have very similar return profiles. What one does find though is that during different market cycles, different ratios enjoy their time in the sun. A brief glance at recent history shows that this is so:\n","\n","* In the late nineties the Price to Sales ratio was most effective as dotcom companies failed to generate any earnings but flew to the moon.\n","* In the recoveries from most bear markets (2002+, 2009+ etc) the biggest bargains judged by asset based measures (P/B, P/C) often massively outperform.\n","Between 2002-2007, EV/EBITDA based metrics were all the rage as the credit bubble grew and private equity sought to buy companies outright.\n","* In the current yield deprived times we live in, the dividend yield has been the most successful value metric as investors have thirsted for income.\n","\n","All this begs the question as to how can one build a perennial strategy based on a single favoured ratio? If you stick to your use of e.g. the P/B ratio at all times you could find that you massively underperform the market for a 3 year period. Nobody enjoys that kind of underperformance and frankly the majority of investors end up throwing in the towel on their strategy right at the wrong time. Is there a solution?\n","\n","Value Ratios Winners: While \"in most cases we were able to observe an average outperformance of value stocks\" they surprisingly found that the growth relative ratios (PEG and lesser known VEG) carried less volatility. The four winning value ratios (with annualised added value of between 7% and 10.5%) proved to be the Price to Cashflow relative to the sector, Price to Sales relative to sector, PEG (12 months forward PE vs Expected Growth), VEG ( EV/EBIT vs Expected Growth).\n","\n","Composite value scoring systems have been used successfully by many investors since Ben Graham originally designed his 'multiplier' that blended the P/E ratio and P/B ratio. This work has been extended by data driven investors for decades, and composite value scores & indices have been published by institutional investment platforms like Starmine (Thomson Reuters), Morningstar, S&P and Societe Generale. One of the most classic and inspiring studies is by James O'Shaughnessy in the 4th edition of What Works on Wall St in which he showed that composite value factors based on an average ranking of 6 ratios - P/S, P/E, P/B, P/CF, EBITDA/EV, and Shareholder Yield (dividends+buybacks) - dramatically beat the market. These ideas can be seen backtested and further verified in the excellent \"Quantitative Value\" book.\n","\n","Given that during different market environments different value ratios perform better it's perhaps unsurprising that if you buy the cheapest stocks in the market based on this composite measure you can achieve better overall returns with less risk over the long run than using the ratios individually.\n","\n","Indeed between 1964 and 2009 O'Shaughnessy showed that using Price/Sales alone - the best 10% of stocks by Price to Sales rebalanced annually returned 14.49% with a standard deviation (volatility) of 20.68%. But by using the composite value factor instead the return was improved to 17.3% and the standard deviation reduced to 17.1%. O'Shaughnessy suggested that these returns could be even further improved by filtering the universe further for higher quality stock.\n","\n","the composite value ratio beats all the other single value ratios bar one - the 'earnings yield' or EBIT/Enterprise Value. For those that don't know this ratio is a core part of Joel Greenblatt's \"Magic Formula\" and very popular amongst value investors.\n","\n","value factor has been struggling in the past few years. \n","\n","It's a constant trial and error. What worked once loses its edge (or premium) eventually i.e. Fama French factors of size and value.

Historically, cheaper stocks have earned higher returns than expensive stocks.\n","**Talk about higher potential for growth for value, but recent value trap**: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2494412\n","\n","It should though be noted that 'cheap' stocks are often distressed, junk or low quality stocks and can often be highly volatile as a result - so one should be careful in the very highest ValueRank companies. Investing in these kind of stocks is known as 'bargain' investing and can require a lot of finesse. Instead of debating on the best style of investing, a safer way to invest in value stocks is to find the best quality value stocks or value stocks whose share prices are turning around - filtering the wheat from the chaff.

Momentum is to do with the correlation between past prices and future prices. Growth investing is trying to identify companies whose future potential earnings growth has not been fully appreciated by the market. One is concerned with prices, the other earnings. Growth companies can have momentum and vice versa but the two are certainly not synonymous.\n","\n","Momentum is present in many asset classes such as commodities not just equities whereas growth investing obviously applies only to equities.\n","\n","Despite being a fairly naive strategy momentum has shown a pretty robust long term cumulative outperformance, whereas the evidence for growth strategies is less clear - probably because it is almost impossible to build a consistent growth strategy. Simply picking high P/E etc. companies that the market expects to grow quickly is the opposite of a value strategy and will earn a negative premium on average.

It allows us to set reasonable expectations for returns and make well-informed decisions about potential investments. Quantifying the sources of risk associated with a portfolio can reveal to what extent the portfolio is actually accomplishing a stated investment goal. If an investment strategy is described as targeting market and sector neutrality, for example, the underlying portfolio should not be achieving significant portions of its returns from a persistent long exposure to the technology sector. While this strategy may show profit over a given timeframe, understanding that those profits are earned on the basis of unintended bets on a single sector may lead the investor to make a different decision about whether and how much capital to allocate. Quantifying risk exposures allows investors and managers to create risk management strategies and refine their portfolio.\n","\n","Developing a risk model allows for a clear distinction between common risk and specific risk. \n","\n","**Common risk** is defined here as risk attributable to common factors which drive returns within the equity stock market. These factors can be composed of either fundamental or statistical information about the underlying investment assets that make up the market. \n","  * Fundamental factors are often observable fundamental ratios reported by companies that issue stock, such as the ratio of book value to share price, or earnings per share. These factors are typically derived from financial and macroeconomic sources of data. \n","  * Statistical factors use mathematical models to explain the correlations between asset returns time-series without consideration of company- specific fundamental data (Axioma, Inc. 2011).\n","\n","Some commonly-cited risk factors are the influence of an overall market index, as in the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) (Sharpe 1964), risk attributable to investing within individual sectors, which give an idea of the space a company works within, as in the BARRA risk model (BARRA, Inc. 1998), or style factors, which mimic investment styles such as investing in “small cap” companies or “high growth” companies, as in the Fama-French 3-factor model .\n","\n","**Specific risk** is defined here as risk that is unexplainable by the common risk factors included in a risk model.

It is the influence of the market on the security.

Unlike the CAPM, which assume markets are perfectly efficient, APT assumes markets sometimes misprice securities, before the market eventually corrects and securities move back to fair value. Using APT, arbitrageurs hope to take advantage of any deviations from fair market value. However, this is not a risk-free operation in the classic sense of arbitrage, because investors are assuming that the model is correct and making directional trades—rather than locking in risk-free profits.\n","\n","It allows us to measure the influence of more than one factor when considering the forces that drive returns. APT is therefore a multi-factor asset pricing model based on the idea that an asset's returns can be predicted using the linear relationship between the asset’s expected return and a number of macroeconomic variables that capture systematic risk. It is a useful tool for analyzing portfolios from a value investing perspective, in order to identify securities that may be temporarily mispriced.\n","\n","APT expresses the returns of individual assets using a multiple linear regression, a linear factor model, like so:\n","\n","$$ R_i = {\\alpha}_i + {\\beta}_{i,0}F_0 +  {\\beta}_{i,1}F_1 + ... + {\\beta}_{i,m}F_m + {\\epsilon}_i$$"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Z3H_oRALYhXv","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Barra Risk Factor Analysis\n","\n","Another category of risk factors are those attributable to investing within individual sectors, which give an idea of the space a company works within. \n","\n","The Barra Risk Factor Analysis is a multi-factor model, created by Barra Inc., used to measure the overall risk associated with a security relative to the market. Barra Risk Factor Analysis incorporates over 40 data metrics, including earnings growth, share turnover and senior debt rating. The model then measures risk factors associated with three main components: industry risk, the risk from exposure to different investment themes and company-specific risk.\n","\n","An element that investors and portfolio managers scrutinize when evaluating the markets or portfolios is investment risk. Identifying and measuring investment risk is one of the most important steps taken when deciding what assets to invest in. This is because the level of risk taken determines the level of return that an asset or portfolio of assets will have at the end of a trading cycle. Consequently, one of the most widely accepted financial principles is the tradeoff between risk and return.\n","\n","One method that a portfolio manager might use to measure investment risk is evaluating the impact of a series of broad factors on the performance of various assets or securities. Using a factor model, the return-generating process for a security is driven by the presence of the various common fundamental factors and the asset's unique sensitivities to each factor. Since a few important factors can explain the risk and return expected on investment to a large degree, factor models can be used to evaluate how much of a portfolio's return is attributable to each common factor exposure. Factor models can be broken down into single-factor and multiple-factor models. One multi-factor model that can be used to measure portfolio risk is the Barra Risk Factor Analysis model.\n","\n","The Barra Risk Factor Analysis was pioneered by Bar Rosenberg, founder of Barra Inc., and is discussed at length in Grinold and Kahn (2000), Conner et al (2010) and Cariño et al (2010). It incorporates a number of factors in its model that can be used to predict and control risk. The multi-factor risk model uses a number of key fundamental factors that represent the features of an investment. Some of these factors include yield, earnings growth, volatility, liquidity, momentum, size, price-earnings ratio, leverage, and growth; factors which are used to describe the risk or returns of a portfolio or asset by moving from quantitative, but unspecified, factors to readily identifiable fundamental characteristics.\n","\n","The Barra Risk Factor Analysis model measures a security's relative risk with a single value-at-risk (VaR) number. This number represents a percentile rank between 0 and 100, with 0 being the least volatile and 100 being the most volatile, relative to the U.S. market. For instance, a security with a value-at-risk number of 80 is calculated to have a greater level of price volatility than 80% of securities in the market and its specific sector. So, if Amazon is assigned a VaR of 80, it means that its stock is more price volatile than 80% of the stock market or the sector in which the company operates.\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ozLw5t73uHN6","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Fama-French Three-Factor Model\n","\n","A final category of risk factors are style factors, which mimic investment styles such as investing in “small cap” companies or “high growth” companies, as in the Fama-French 3-factor model .\n","\n","In 1996, Fama and French observed that two classes of stocks have tended to do better than the market as a whole: (i) small caps and (ii) stocks with a high book-to-market ratio (B/P, customarily called value stocks, contrasted with growth stocks).

They also tested each ratio relative to each stock and sector's historical average in what looks like a very comprehensive backtest.\n","\n","To figure out which ratios to include in the end portfolio, they picked the ratios that generated portfolios of stocks with the highest Sharpe Ratios - essentially these are the portfolios offering the highest returns for the least volatility.\n","\n","Also maybe avoid picking the ones that are too correlated\n","\n","*Predictability window*: What's fascinating about momentum strategies versus value strategies is that they work on completely different timeframes. The winning value ratios all work best on 12-24 month time horizons, whereas the momentum ratios work best on 3-6 month time horizons. As a result, the optimal blended portfolios have holding periods of 12 months - a boon for individual investors who want to put this kind of strategy to work, but don't want to trade like amphetamine fueled schizophrenic rabbits.\n","\n","  b. **Alpha Combination:** combine many single alphas into a final alpha which has stronger prediction power than the best single alpha. This is often due to the noise in each alpha being canceled out by noise in other alphas, allowing signal to come through.\n","\n","Beta is a measure of the returns (of the asset or portfolio of assets) which are attributed to the market. The farther from zero, the more sensitive it is to the returns of the market (> 0 is same way, < 0 is opposite way).\n","Alpha is a measure of the returns which are NOT attributed to the market. It's your edge.\n","\n","When we combine criteria like in the paradigms above, we do not know how each criteria (or signal), singled out, provides to the alpha. And we don't know:\n","* Just because you run a backtest and is profitable, you don't know whether the signal you're trading on has any alpha, you might have just gotten lucky.  \n","* Alternatively, if your backtest is not profitable, that doesn't mean your signal doesn't have alpha. It means your strategy was bad.\n","Maybe other factors in the strategy helped making it good or bad i.e. weight allocation, rebalancing etc., so better to isolate the concern of alpha factors and test them separately. After that, we find those that complement each other i.e. a factors that underperformed compared to another that outperformed during a certain period of time and vice versa. \n","\n","To determine whether something is a factor, you should be able to rank stocks based on such factor, and allocate to a different portfolio, and observe monotically decreasing returns."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PljVChUV-0mr","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Value and Momentum\n","\n","Value + Momentum when paired alone is seen as one of the most successful stock market strategies.

Many traders, such as Bill O'Neil, are willing to buy highly priced stocks as the real market leaders tend to sell at a premium. These are often stocks that are expensive for good reason - due to continued blistering share price growth, earnings growth and exceptional cashflow, profitability and financial results. These stocks can still be worth purchasing, though greater caution should be taken with any highly priced stock as the volatility can be high (e.g. if the company starts to disappoint)."]}]}
