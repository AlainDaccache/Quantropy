Portfolio Allocation Models
***************************

The aim of **portfolio allocation** is to construct a portfolio by determining the proportions of our portfolio that each
asset should hold, according to *quantifiable characteristics* such as risk, return, covariance matrices, as well as
*mathematical methodologies* such as optimization (i.e. CLA) and machine learning techniques (i.e. hierarchical clustering).

Let's use the *Dow Jones Industrial Average* as our market proxy. It will be our main use case throughout this tutorial.

>>> market_portfolio = Portfolio(assets='^DJI')

Modern Portfolio Theory
=======================

In a 1952 essay, economist Harry Markowitz introduced **Modern Portfolio Theory** (MPT). Also termed *mean-variance analysis*,
it is a mathematical framework for determining the proportion of an asset in the portfolio, so that the expected return is maximized
for a given level of risk. It formalizes the idea of *diversification*, i.e. that owning different types of financial assets is less
risky than owning only one. Essentially, an asset's risk and return should not be assessed by itself, but by how it
contributes to the risk and overall return of a portfolio.

Capital Allocation Line
+++++++++++++++++++++++

The tangent to the upper part of the hyperbolic boundary is the **Capital Allocation Line (CAL)**, determining how to allocate
funds between a risky asset and a risk-free asset. It is given by the equation:

.. math::
    E(R_C) = R_F + \sigma_C + \frac{E(R_P) - R_F}{\sigma_P}

where :math:`P` is the sub-portfolio of risky assets at the tangency with the Markowitz bullet, :math:`F` is the
risk-free asset, and :math:`C` is a combination of portfolios :math:`P` and :math:`F`. It is also known as the **Capital Market Line (CML)**.

Security Market Line
+++++++++++++++++++++
The **Security Market Line (SML)**

Capital Asset Pricing Model
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As we've seen in the Asset Pricing Models module, the CAPM states that the expected return of any given asset should equal
:math:`R_i = R_f + \beta_i * (R_m - R_f)`, with :math:`\alpha` being the error term having an expected value of zero in theory.
Thus, the only way to achieve higher expected returns is taking on more :math:`\beta` (given that :math:`(R_m - R_f) > 0`).
Every individual stock has some idiosyncratic risk in addition to its market :math:`\beta` (true always when correlated less than
perfectly with the market).

.. note::
    The total risk is a combination of systematic and unsystematic (*idiosyncratic*) risk.
    *   Systematic risk is given by the estimated coefficient of a regression of a security on a market portfolio,
        :math:`\beta_{security, market} = \frac{\sigma_{security, market}}{\sigma_{market}^2}`.
    *   The idiosyncratic risk is the portion of risk unexplained by the market factor, :math:`1 - R^2`.
        Empirically, the idiosyncratic risk in a single-factor contemporaneous CAPM model with US equities is around 60-70%.

Through diversification (i.e. by the *mean-variance optimization* process), unsystematic risk is eliminated.
Thus, we can get the best return/risk ratio by buying the market portfolio, as buying anything else, we could not get
more expected return for the same :math:`\beta`, but would only get some additional idiosyncratic risk.

To maximize investor's utility function, Modern Portfolio Theory suggests holding the combination of a risk-free
asset and optimal risky portfolio (ORP) lying on a tangency of the efficient frontier and capital market line.
Modern Portfolio Theory also suggests that optimal risky portfolio is a market portfolio (e.g. capitalization-weighted index).

If we assume markets are fully efficient and all assets are fairly priced, we don't have any reason to deviate
from the market portfolio in our asset allocation. In such case, we don't even need to know equilibrium asset
returns nor perform any kind of portfolio optimization. An optimization based on equilibrium asset returns would
lead back to the same market portfolio anyway.

.. note::
    Using historical data to estimate expected returns implies nonzero expected :math:`\alpha`-s for all assets.
    This is not coherent with the CAPM framework, so using this methodology within MPT, it has nothing to do with CAPM.
    In effect by using MPT this way, you are generating a momentum based investment strategy, as you assume that assets
    that have had good returns historically will continue to have good returns in the future.


This framework has then been improved by other economists and mathematicians who went on to account for its limitations.

Treynor-Black Model (1973)
--------------------------

Unlike the **Markowitz's** approach for portfolio allocation, the **Treynor-Black model** is a type of *active* portfolio
management.

.. autoclass:: matilda.quantitative_analysis.portfolio_optimization.TreynorBlackModel

Black-Litterman Model (1990)
----------------------------

The **Blackâ€“Litterman model** optimization is an extension of unconstrained Markowitz optimization that incorporates relative
and absolute 'views' on inputs of risk and returns from.

Post Modern Portfolio Theory (1991)
===================================

**Post-modern portfolio theory** extends MPT by adopting non-normally distributed, asymmetric, and fat-tailed measures of risk.
Two major limitations of MPT are in measuring *risk* and *return* in a way that doesn't represent the realities of the
investment markets. Specifically, it assumes the following:

*   **Risk proxy:** The variance of portfolio returns is the correct measure of investment risk. Using the variance (or its square root,
    the standard deviation) implies that uncertainty about better-than-expected returns is equally averred as uncertainty
    about returns that are worse than expected. It has long been recognized that investors typically do not view as
    risky those returns above the minimum they must earn in order to achieve their investment objectives.
    They believe that risk has to do with the bad outcomes (i.e., returns below a required target), not the good
    outcomes (i.e., returns in excess of the target) and that losses weigh more heavily than gains.

*   **Statistical distribution:** The investment returns of all securities and portfolios can be adequately represented by a joint elliptical
    distribution, such as the **normal distribution**. The assumption of a normal distribution is a major practical limitation,
    because it is symmetrical. Using the normal distribution to model the pattern of investment returns makes investment results with
    more upside than downside returns appear more risky than they really are.

Recent advances in portfolio and financial theory, coupled with increased computing power, have overcome these limitations.
The resulting expanded risk/return paradigm is known as Post-Modern Portfolio Theory, or PMPT.
Thus, MPT becomes nothing more than a special (symmetrical) case of PMPT.

.. note::   The risk measures we will describe below are mainly used to evaluate mutual fund and portfolio manager performance.
            It is important to note that some variables will cause differing results, such as the *frequency* (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)
            and the *window*(from which date to which date). For example, some services calculate 'during the last 3 years, the 30 days X is Y'.

            Also, regarding time horizon, if you have a mean for a horizon of say 10 days, and a volatility over a year, then
            you can convert that volatility to be over the horizon by multiplying by :math:`\sqrt{10/252}`.

As a case, let's take as an example the following portfolio

>>> from portfolio_management.Portfolio import Portfolio
>>> from datetime import datetime
>>> assets = ['AAPL', 'V', 'KO', 'CAT']
>>> portfolio = Portfolio(assets=assets)
>>> portfolio.slice_dataframe(to_date=datetime(2021, 1, 1), from_date=datetime(2016, 1, 1))
>>> portfolio_returns = portfolio.get_weighted_sum_returns(weights=np.ones(len(assets)) / len(assets))
>>> print(portfolio_returns.head())

Value at Risk (VaR)
-------------------

Measures of risk-adjusted return based on volatility treat all deviations from the mean as risk, whereas measures of
risk-adjusted return based on lower partial moments consider only deviations below some predefined minimum return
threshold, t as risk i.e. positive deviations aren't risky. VaR is a more probabilistic view of loss as the risk of a portfolio

Partial Moments Risk
--------------------

These measures consider downside risk, and do not assume that returns are normally adjusted.
The mean and variance do not completely describe the distribution, therefore using only both of
them (i.e. the first and second moment of a distribution), would technically assume a normal distribution.
