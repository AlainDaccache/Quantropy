            ratios are commonly used to compare banks, because most assets and liabilities of banks are constantly valued at
            market values.

        *   This ratio also gives some idea of whether an investor is paying too much for what would be left if the company
            went bankrupt immediately. For companies in distress, the book value is usually calculated without the intangible
            assets that would have no resale value. In such cases, P/B should also be calculated on a "diluted" basis, because

    The price/earnings to growth ratio (or PEG ratio) is a valuation metric for determining the relative trade-off
    between the price of a stock, the earnings generated per share (EPS), and the company's expected growth.

    *Category:* Market Value Ratios

    *Subcategory:* Equity Value Ratios

    *Notes:*
        *   In general, the P/E ratio is higher for a company with a higher growth rate. Thus, using just the P/E ratio
            would make high-growth companies appear overvalued relative to others. It is assumed that by dividing the P/E
            ratio by the earnings growth rate, the resulting ratio is better for comparing companies with different growth
            rates. Therefore, a lower ratio is "better" (cheaper) and a higher ratio is "worse" (expensive).

        *   According to Peter Lynch in his book *One Up on Wall Street*, the P/E ratio of any company that's fairly
            priced will equal its growth rate", i.e., a fairly valued company will have its PEG equal to 1.

        *   The P/E ratio used in the calculation may be projected or trailing. The (annual) growth rate is expressed as
            a percent value, and should use real growth only, to correct for inflation. It may be the
            expected growth rate for the next year or the next five years.
