    The **Treynor reward to volatility model** is a measurement of the returns earned in excess of that which could have
    been earned on an investment that has no diversifiable risk (e.g., Treasury bills or a completely diversified portfolio),
    per unit of market risk assumed. In other words, it calculates the excess returns generated by a portfolio
    :math:`r_i - r_f`, where :math:`r_i` is the portfolio :math:`i`'s returns and :math:`r_f` is the risk-free
    rate, then discounts it by portfolio :math:`i`'s beta, :math:`\\beta_i`.

    Like the Sharpe ratio, the Treynor ratio (T) does not quantify the value added, if any, of active portfolio
    management. It is a ranking criterion only. A ranking of portfolios based on the Treynor Ratio is only useful if
    the portfolios under consideration are sub-portfolios of a broader, fully diversified portfolio.
    If this is not the case, portfolios with identical systematic risk, but different total risk, will be rated the same.
    But the portfolio with a higher total risk is less diversified and therefore has a higher unsystematic risk which is
    not priced in the market.

    An alternative method of ranking portfolio management is Jensen's alpha, which quantifies the added return as the
    excess return above the security market line in the capital asset pricing model. As these two methods both determine
    rankings based on systematic risk alone, they will rank portfolios identically.

    The **Sharpe ratio** was developed by William F. Sharpe in 1966. It is an extension of the *Traynor ratio*, as
    it discounts expected excess returns by the volatility. It measures the performance of an investment

    In other words, it is the difference between the returns of the investment  and the risk-free return, divided by
    the standard deviation of the investment (i.e., its volatility). It represents the additional amount of return
    that an investor receives per unit of increase in risk.

    The *ex-ante* ratio is defined as :math:`\\frac{E[R_a - R_b]}{\\sigma_a}` where :math:`R_{a}` is the asset return,
    :math:`R_b` is the risk-free return (such as a U.S. Treasury security). :math:`E[R_{a}-R_{b}]` is the expected
    value of the excess of the asset return over the benchmark return, and :math:`\\sigma _{a}` is the standard deviation

    The **Jensen's alpha** determines the abnormal return of a security or portfolio of securities over the theoretical

    The theoretical return is predicted by a market model, most commonly the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).
    The market model uses statistical methods to predict the appropriate risk-adjusted return of an asset.

    The CAPM for instance uses beta as a multiplier. The CAPM return is supposed to be 'risk adjusted',
    which means it takes account of the relative riskiness of the asset. This is based on the concept that riskier
    assets should have higher expected returns than less risky assets. If an asset's return is even higher than the
    risk adjusted return, that asset is said to have "positive alpha" or "abnormal returns".
    Investors are constantly seeking investments that have higher alpha.

    positive Alpha, unless by chance.
