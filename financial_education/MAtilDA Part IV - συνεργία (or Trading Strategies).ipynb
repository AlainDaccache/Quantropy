Similar approaches to generate composite scores have been employed by institutional giants such as Thomson Reuters, Morningstar and S&P.\n","\n","Each ranking factor is based upon a blended combination of the ratios and metrics that have been proven to have the greatest bearing on future stock market returns i.e. equally weighted combination. You can even make a rank of ranks i.e. of value rank, quality rank, momentum rank.

This is done by analyzing companies that are relatively similar (same industry or subsector) and correlated but are valued differently by the market.

For example if a pair of two highly correlated assets historically traded in a tight range but now trades one or more standard deviations away from historical means. A trader would look for a pair to revert to the mean.\n","\n"," Some popular pair trades are two similar companies in the same sector.
