# alpaca-trade-api-python

`alpaca-trade-api-python` is a python library for the [Alpaca Commission Free Trading API](https://alpaca.markets).
It allows rapid trading algo development easily, with support for
both REST and streaming data interfaces. For details of each API behavior,
please see the online [API document](https://docs.alpaca.markets).
```diff
- To use the Streaming abilities go to section called StreamConn
```


Note this module supports only python version 3.6 and above, due to
the async/await and websockets module dependency.

## Install

```bash
$ pip3 install alpaca-trade-api
```

## Example

In order to call Alpaca's trade API, you need to sign up for an account and obtain API key pairs. Replace <key_id> and <secret_key> with what you get from the web console.

### REST example
```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

api = tradeapi.REST('<key_id>', '<secret_key>', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') # or use ENV Vars shown below
account = api.get_account()
api.list_positions()
```

please note the exact format of the dates

## Example Scripts

Please see the `examples/` folder for some example scripts that make use of this API

## API Document

The HTTP API document is located at https://docs.alpaca.markets/

## API Version

API Version now defaults to 'v2', however, if you still have a 'v1' account, you may need to specify api_version='v1' to properly use the API until you migrate.

## Authentication

The Alpaca API requires API key ID and secret key, which you can obtain from the
web console after you sign in.  You can pass `key_id` and `secret_key` to the initializers of
`REST` or `StreamConn` as arguments, or set up environment variables as
outlined below.

## Alpaca Environment Variables

The Alpaca SDK will check the environment for a number of variables that can be used rather than hard-coding these into your scripts.

| Environment                      | default                                                                                | Description                                                                                                            |

## REST

The `REST` class is the entry point for the API request.  The instance of this
class provides all REST API calls such as account, orders, positions,
and bars.

Each returned object is wrapped by a subclass of the `Entity` class (or a list of it).
This helper class provides property access (the "dot notation") to the
json object, backed by the original object stored in the `_raw` field.
It also converts certain types to the appropriate python object.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

api = tradeapi.REST()
account = api.get_account()
account.status
=> 'ACTIVE'
```

The `Entity` class also converts the timestamp string field to a pandas.Timestamp
object.  Its `_raw` property returns the original raw primitive data unmarshaled
from the response JSON text.

Please note that the API is throttled, currently 200 requests per minute, per account.  If your client exceeds this number, a 429 Too many requests status will be returned and this library will retry according to the retry environment variables as configured.

If the retries are exceeded, or other API error is returned, `alpaca_trade_api.rest.APIError` is raised.
You can access the following information through this object.
- the API error code: `.code` property
- the API error message: `str(error)`
- the original request object: `.request` property
- the original response objecgt: `.response` property
- the HTTP status code: `.status_code` property

## StreamConn

The `StreamConn` class provides WebSocket-based event-driven
interfaces.  Using the `on` decorator of the instance, you can
define custom event handlers that are called when the pattern
is matched on the channel name.  Once event handlers are set up,
call the `run` method which runs forever until a critical exception
is raised. This module itself does not provide any threading
capability, so if you need to consume the messages pushed from the
server, you need to run it in a background thread.

We provide 2 price data websockets. The polygon data, and the alpaca data.
We default to Alpaca data, and one must explicitly specify the polygon data stream in order to use that.
It is done by passing the `data_stream` keyword to the `__init__()` function of `StreamConn` (options: `'alpacadatav1', 'polygon'`)

This class provides a unique interface to the two interfaces, both
Alpaca's account/trade updates events and Polygon's price updates.
One connection is established when the `subscribe()` is called with
the corresponding channel names.  For example, if you subscribe to
`trade_updates`, a WebSocket connects to Alpaca stream API, and
if `AM.*` given to the `subscribe()` method, a WebSocket connection is
established to Polygon's interface. If your account is enabled for
Alpaca Data API streaming, adding `alpacadatav1/` prefix to `T.<symbol>`,
`Q.<symbol>` and `AM.<symbol>` will also connect to the data stream
interface.

The `run` method is a short-cut to start subscribing to channels and
running forever.  The call will be blocked forever until a critical
exception is raised, and each event handler is called asynchronously
upon the message arrivals.

The `run` method tries to reconnect to the server in the event of
connection failure.  In this case, you may want to reset your state
which is best in the `connect` event.  The method still raises
an exception in the case any other unknown error happens inside the
event loop.

The `msg` object passed to each handler is wrapped by the entity
helper class if the message is from the server.

Each event handler has to be a marked as `async`.  Otherwise,
a `ValueError` is raised when registering it as an event handler.

```python
conn = StreamConn()

@conn.on(r'^trade_updates$')
async def on_account_updates(conn, channel, account):
    print('account', account)

@conn.on(r'^status$')
async def on_status(conn, channel, data):
    print('polygon status update', data)

@conn.on(r'^AM$')
async def on_minute_bars(conn, channel, bar):
    print('bars', bar)

@conn.on(r'^A$')
async def on_second_bars(conn, channel, bar):
    print('bars', bar)

# blocks forever
conn.run(['trade_updates', 'AM.*'])

# if Data API streaming is enabled
# conn.run(['trade_updates', 'alpacadatav1/AM.SPY'])

```

You will likely call the `run` method in a thread since it will keep running
unless an exception is raised.

| StreamConn Method                     | Description                                                                            | 
| --------------------------------      | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| subscribe(channels)                   |  Request "listen" to the server.  `channels` must be a list of string channel names.|
| unsubscribe(channels)                 |  Request to stop "listening" to the server.  `channels` must be a list of string channel names.|
| run(channels)                         |  Goes into an infinite loop and awaits for messages from the server.  You should set up event listeners using the `on` or `register` method before calling `run`. |
| on(channel_pat)                       |  As in the above example, this is a decorator method to add an event handler function. `channel_pat` is used as a regular expression pattern to filter stream names.|
| register(channel_pat, func)           |  Registers a function as an event handler that is triggered by the stream events that match with `channel_path` regular expression. Calling this method with the same `channel_pat` will overwrite the old handler.|
| deregister(channel_pat)               | Deregisters the event handler function that was previously registered via `on` or `register` method. |


#### Debugging
Websocket exceptions may occur during execution.
It will usually happen during the `consume()` method, which basically is the 
websocket steady-state.<br>
exceptions during the consume method may occur due to:
- server disconnections
- error while handling the response data

We handle the first issue by reconnecting the websocket every time there's a disconnection.
The second issue, is usually a user's code issue. To help you find it, we added a flag to the 
StreamConn object called `debug`. It is set to False by default, but you can turn it on to get a more
verbose logs when this exception happens.
Turn it on like so `StreamConn(debug=True)`  

## Logging
You should define a logger in your app in order to make sure you get all the messages from the different components.<br>
It will help you debug, and make sure you don't miss issues when they occur.<br>
The simplest way to define a logger, if you have no experience with the python logger - will be something like this:
```py
import logging
logging.basicConfig(format='%(asctime)s %(message)s', level=logging.INFO)
```

# Polygon API Service

Alpaca's API key ID can be used to access Polygon API, the documentation for
which is found [here](https://polygon.io/docs/).
This python SDK wraps their API service and seamlessly integrates it with the Alpaca
API. `alpaca_trade_api.REST.polygon` will be the `REST` object for Polygon.

The example below gives AAPL daily OHLCV data in a DataFrame format.

```py
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

api = tradeapi.REST()
# all of these examples work
aapl = api.polygon.historic_agg_v2('AAPL', 1, 'day', _from='2019-01-01', to='2019-02-01').df
aapl = api.polygon.historic_agg_v2('AAPL', 1, 'day', _from=datetime.datetime(2019, 1, 1), to='2019-02-01').df
aapl = api.polygon.historic_agg_v2('AAPL', 1, 'day', _from=datetime.date(2019, 1, 1), to='2019-02-01').df
aapl = api.polygon.historic_agg_v2('AAPL', 1, 'day', _from=pd.Timestamp('2019-01-01'), to='2019-02-01').df
# timestamp should be in milliseconds datetime.datetime(2019, 1, 1).timestamp()*1000 == 1546293600000
aapl = api.polygon.historic_agg_v2('AAPL', 1, 'day', _from=1546293600000, to='2019-02-01').df
```
and here's a minute example usage:
```py
import pytz
NY = 'America/New_York'

start = pytz.timezone(NY).localize(datetime(2020,1,2,9,30)).timestamp()*1000  # timestamp in micro seconds
# another alternative will be: start = pd.Timestamp('2020-01-02 09:30', tz=NY).value/1e6
end = pytz.timezone(NY).localize(datetime(2020,1,2,16,0)).timestamp()*1000
df = api.polygon.historic_agg_v2('AAPL', 1, 'minute', _from=start, to=end).df

```

## polygon/REST
It is initialized through the alpaca `REST` object.
