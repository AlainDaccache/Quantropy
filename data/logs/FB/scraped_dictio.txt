Such annual limitations could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before their utilization. The events that may cause ownership changes include, but are not limited to, a cumulative stock ownership change of greater than 50% over a three\u2010year period.The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Tax Act imposed a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and generally eliminated U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiary distribution.

The amount of interest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $747 million and $340 million, respectively.If the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits of $7.86 billion as of December 31, 2019 were realized in a future period, this would result in a tax benefit of $4.71 billion within our provision of income taxes at such time.On July 27, 2015, the United States Tax Court issued a decision Tax Court Decision in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, which concluded that related parties in a cost sharing arrangement are not required to share expenses related to share-based compensation. The Tax Court Decision was appealed by the Commissioner to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Ninth Circuit. On June 7, 2019, the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion that reversed the Tax Court Decision. Based on the Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion, we recorded a cumulative income tax expense of $1.11 billion in the second quarter of 2019. On July 22, 2019, the taxpayer requested a rehearing before the full Ninth Circuit and the request was denied on November 12, 2019. The taxpayer has until February 10, 2020 to request a hearing before the Supreme Court of the United States. As a result, the final outcome of the case is uncertain. In November 2019, we made a $1.64 billion payment related to this matter and recorded the payment to net against the related tax liability included within other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. If the Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion is reversed, we would anticipate recording an income tax benefit at that time. We are subject to taxation in the United States and various other state and foreign jurisdictions. The material jurisdictions in which we are subject to potential examination include the United States and Ireland. We are under examination by the Internal Revenue Service IRS for our 2014 through 2016 tax years and by the Ireland tax authorities for our 2012 through 2015 tax years. Our 2017 and subsequent tax years remain open to examination by the IRS. Our 2016 and subsequent tax years remain open to examination in Ireland.In July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency Notice from the IRS related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to the 2010 tax year, the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the Notice. The case is scheduled for trial beginning in February 2020. On January 15, 2020, the IRS filed its Pretrial Memorandum in the case stating that it planned to assert at trial an adjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the Notice. The IRS did not provide any information about how it intends to apply the revised adjustment to future years. Based on the information provided, we believe that, if the IRS prevails in its updated position, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated, aggregate amount of up to approximately $9.0 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. return, plus interest and any penalties asserted. In March 2018, we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through 2013 tax years. The IRS applied its position from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new adjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certain tax credits that we claimed. If the IRS prevails in its position for these new adjustments, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of up to approximately $680 million in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. returns, plus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with the positions of the IRS in the second Notice and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the second Notice. We have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740, Income Taxes, that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the IRS in the two Notices and The following table reflects changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits in millions: Year Ended December 31,  2019 2018 2017Gross unrecognized tax

Such annual limitations could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before their utilization. The events that may cause ownership changes include, but are not limited to, a cumulative stock ownership change of greater than 50% over a three\u2010year period.The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Tax Act imposed a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and generally eliminated U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiary distribution.

The amount of interest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $747 million and $340 million, respectively.If the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits of $7.86 billion as of December 31, 2019 were realized in a future period, this would result in a tax benefit of $4.71 billion within our provision of income taxes at such time.On July 27, 2015, the United States Tax Court issued a decision Tax Court Decision in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, which concluded that related parties in a cost sharing arrangement are not required to share expenses related to share-based compensation. The Tax Court Decision was appealed by the Commissioner to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Ninth Circuit. On June 7, 2019, the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion that reversed the Tax Court Decision. Based on the Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion, we recorded a cumulative income tax expense of $1.11 billion in the second quarter of 2019. On July 22, 2019, the taxpayer requested a rehearing before the full Ninth Circuit and the request was denied on November 12, 2019. The taxpayer has until February 10, 2020 to request a hearing before the Supreme Court of the United States. As a result, the final outcome of the case is uncertain. In November 2019, we made a $1.64 billion payment related to this matter and recorded the payment to net against the related tax liability included within other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. If the Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion is reversed, we would anticipate recording an income tax benefit at that time. We are subject to taxation in the United States and various other state and foreign jurisdictions. The material jurisdictions in which we are subject to potential examination include the United States and Ireland. We are under examination by the Internal Revenue Service IRS for our 2014 through 2016 tax years and by the Ireland tax authorities for our 2012 through 2015 tax years. Our 2017 and subsequent tax years remain open to examination by the IRS. Our 2016 and subsequent tax years remain open to examination in Ireland.In July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency Notice from the IRS related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to the 2010 tax year, the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the Notice. The case is scheduled for trial beginning in February 2020. On January 15, 2020, the IRS filed its Pretrial Memorandum in the case stating that it planned to assert at trial an adjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the Notice. The IRS did not provide any information about how it intends to apply the revised adjustment to future years. Based on the information provided, we believe that, if the IRS prevails in its updated position, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated, aggregate amount of up to approximately $9.0 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. return, plus interest and any penalties asserted. In March 2018, we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through 2013 tax years. The IRS applied its position from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new adjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certain tax credits that we claimed. If the IRS prevails in its position for these new adjustments, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of up to approximately $680 million in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. returns, plus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with the positions of the IRS in the second Notice and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the second Notice. We have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740, Income Taxes, that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from the
